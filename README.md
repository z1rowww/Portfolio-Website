# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website serves as my initial project as I embark on my journey into the world of front-end development.

## About Me

I am a novice enthusiast keen on exploring the realm of front-end development. This website represents my initial foray into HTML, CSS, and perhaps a touch of JavaScript. As a beginner, I am eager to learn and grow, and this project marks my initial steps in this exciting field.

## Site Details

This website aims to showcase my early understanding of web development. It consists of a simple layout built primarily using HTML and styled with CSS. It serves as a foundation upon which I plan to expand my skills and incorporate more complex functionalities and designs in the future.
